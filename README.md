# D-D-Dotfiles

These are my personal config files that I have only ever used on macOS.

## Cut and Paste Shell Commands

`chsh -s /bin/zsh`

`git clone git@github.com:sodapopcan/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles`

`cd ~/dotfiles`

`./install`

## Manual Steps

### Alacritty

In order to use `cmd-q` and `cmd-h` in the ways I want to use them, they must be
disabled at the OS level.  Go to Preferences -> Keyboard -> Shortcuts -> App
Shortcuts to override them.  I prefix with `cmd-ctrl-shift-`.
